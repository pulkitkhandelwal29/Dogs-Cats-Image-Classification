# Dogs-Cats Image Classification
<hr>

This is a **Deep Learning Project using Convolutional Neural Network(CNN)**.<br>
In this project, we need to classify whether the images are of Dogs or Cats?<br>
We are able to predict with the accuracy of 80%

### Data
Data is taken from <a href="https://www.kaggle.com/chetankv/dogs-cats-images">Kaggle</a>

### Libraries
* Keras
* Tensorflow
* Pandas
* Numpy

### Approach
* Importing the Layers from Keras
* Initialising the CNN
* Compiling the CNN
* Summarizing the Model
* Concept of Image Augmentation
